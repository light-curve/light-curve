# `light-curve`

[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/light-curve/light-curve/master.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/light-curve/light-curve/master)

## Irregular time series analysis toolbox for Rust and Python

The project is aimed to build high-performance tools for light curve analysis suitable to process alert and archival data of current [ZTF](https://ztf.caltech.edu) and future [Vera Rubin Observatory LSST](https://lsst.org) photometric surveys.

The most of the code base is written on Rust and split into several crates.

### Structure

- [`light-curve`](./light-curve)**WIP** A crate which will be an umbrella for other Rust crates
- [`light-curve-common`](./light-curve-common) ![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/light-curve-common) [![docs.rs badge](https://docs.rs/light-curve-common/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/light-curve-common) Common tools for other crates
- [`light-curve-dmdt`](./light-curve-dmdt) ![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/light-curve-dmdt) [![docs.rs badge](https://docs.rs/light-curve-dmdt/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/light-curve-dmdt) [dm-dt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06257) mapper crate and executable
- [`light-curve-feature`](./light-curve-feature) ![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/light-curve-feature) [![docs.rs badge](https://docs.rs/light-curve-feature/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/light-curve-feature) A collection of features to be extracted from light curves
- `light-curve-interpol`**WIP** Light curve interpolation tools. Currently it includes linear interpolation only
- [`python/light-curve`](./python/light-curve) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/light-curve-python.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/light-curve/) Python bindings to `light-curve-dmdt` and `light-curve-feature`
- `test-data` is [a Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) linking to [the `test-data` repository](https://github.com/light-curve/test-data) containing light curves required for testing, benchmarking and development of the new features. Use `git clone --recurse-submodules` to download the repo with this submodule
- `.ci` Continuous integration related stuff, currently it is just a custom Docker [maturin](https://github.com/pyo3/maturin) image used to publish x86-64 Linux Python packages via Github Actions
- `.github` GitHub related utils, such as dependabot configuration and Actions workflows

### Versioning

All package versions are unrelated, which means that `light-curve-python v0.a.b` can depend on `light-curve-dmdt v0.d.e` and `light-curve-feature v0.f.g`. We use [semver](https://semver.org), so a release `0.3.0` can be backward incompatible with `0.2.5` version of the same crate. Please refer to `CHAMGELOG.md` in sub-directories for the changes between versions.
