# Changelog

All notable changes to `light-curve-feature` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- This `CHANGELOG.md` file
- `Feature` enum containing all available features, it implements `FeatureEvaluator`
- (De)serialization with [`serde`](http://serde.rs) is implemented for all features
- JSON schema generation with [`schemars`](http://graham.cool/schemars/) is implemented for all features  
- `TimeSeries` and `DataSample` use `ndarray::CowArray` to hold data, their constructors accept `ArrayBase` objects

### Changed

- `FeatureExtractor`, `Bins` and `Periodogram` accepts `Feature` enum objects instead of `Box<FeatureEvaluator>`
- Periodogram-related `NyquistFreq` and `PeriodogramPower` are changed from traits to enums
- `TimeSeries::new` accepts non-optional weights, use `TimeSeries::new_without_weight` to initialize time series with unity weight array 
- `BazinFit` is parameterized by a curve-fit algorithm, MCMC and GSL's LMSDER are available, but the last one requires non-default `gsl` Cargo feature. MCMC becomes the default algorithm, some wide boundary conditions are included  
- Rename `BazinFit::get_names()[1]` from "bazin_fit_offset" to "bazin_fit_baseline"
- Add `VillarFit` feature for the Villar function [arXiv:1905.07422](http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07422), see `BazinFit` above for technical details
